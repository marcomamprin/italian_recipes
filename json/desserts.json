        "name": "Tiramisu",
        "ingredients": [
            "6 large egg yolks",
            "150 gr granulated sugar",
            "250 gr mascarpone cheese",
            "400 ml heavy whipping cream",
            "2 packages ladyfingers (approximately 400 gr total)",
            "350 ml strong brewed espresso or coffee, cooled",
            "80 ml coffee-flavored liqueur (e.g., Kahl√∫a) or dark rum (optional)",
            "Unsweetened cocoa powder, for dusting",
            "30 gr semisweet chocolate, grated (optional)"
        ],
        "steps": [
            "In a medium saucepan, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar over medium heat until the mixture is thick and pale. Remove from heat and allow to cool.",
            "In a large bowl, combine mascarpone cheese with the cooled egg yolk mixture until smooth.",
            "In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream to stiff peaks. Gently fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture until well combined.",
            "In a shallow dish, combine the cooled espresso or coffee with the coffee-flavored liqueur or rum, if using.",
            "Quickly dip each ladyfinger into the coffee mixture, ensuring they are soaked but not soggy. Arrange a layer of soaked ladyfingers in the bottom of a 20x30 cm dish.",
            "Spread half of the mascarpone mixture over the ladyfingers. Repeat the process with another layer of soaked ladyfingers and the remaining mascarpone mixture.",
            "Cover and refrigerate the tiramisu for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight, to allow the flavors to meld.",
            "Before serving, dust the top with unsweetened cocoa powder and sprinkle with grated semisweet chocolate, if desired."
